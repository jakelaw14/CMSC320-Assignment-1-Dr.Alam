Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: One might consider to use git because of the ease it allows users 
to manage their code, track their edits and progress, and save code at. It 
is popular in companies when multiple people are working on a project at 
once. It allows for some people to edit different pieces at either the 
same or different times, then merge it together to combine their edits, 
providing extreme efficiency.
