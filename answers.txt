Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how

Answer: A field that data science could be applied is food 
chain/restaurants. Using data science can give the owners of restaurants 
an idea of what people enjoy the most, what they can do that will increase 
the number of customers that come, and manage their resources in an 
effective way, overall helping the total revenue they are taking in.
