Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: One might consider to use git because of the ease it allows users 
to manage their code, track their edits and progress, and save code at. It 
is popular in companies when multiple people are working on a project at 
once. It allows for some people to edit different pieces at either the 
same or different times, then merge it together to combine their edits, 
providing extreme efficiency.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how 
it might help

Answer: A field that data science could be applied is food 
chain/restaurants. Using data science can give the owners of restaurants 
an idea of what people enjoy the most, what they can do that will increase 
the number of customers that come, and manage their resources in an 
effective way, overall helping the total revenue they are taking in.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging keeps the commit sequence intact by combining the two 
edits of two branches into one single branch. Rebasing on the other hand 
will rewrite the history by putting changes from one branch at the 
beginning of another branch.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: Skills I hope to improve during this course include being able to 
process all types of data, and able to manipulate them in any way I need 
to, to hopefully find the end goal result I was looking for. Not only this 
but also being able to visualize the data, where in situations like side 
projects, I can display the data and teach others about my findings.
